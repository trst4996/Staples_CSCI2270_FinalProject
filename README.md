# Staples_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:  
This project will be a text based RPG game. That will ask you question to become a god or be killed.  When you fight with magic it uses a hashsum value.  The other attacks are based on a random number generator.  The final question will change after you try once.  The monster hp is also random.  If you die, the code will display all the fallen.  If you become a god, the code will display all the gods. Also, there are other ways to become a god if you answer the question a different correct way.

How to Run:  
To run this game you just answer the questions.  The code will accept any input, so you don't have to worry about anything.  The code will repeat until you don't enter "y" in the part where you are asked if you want to play a game.
